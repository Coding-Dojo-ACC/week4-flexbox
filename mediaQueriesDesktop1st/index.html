            <p>A garden is a friend you can visit anytime. Mother nature has the best box of crayons. To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow. Nature never goes out of style. Anyone who has time for drama is not gardening enough. Gardeners are alchemists. They know how to turn crap into crops.</p>

            <p>What did the bra say to the hat? You go on a head, I gotta give these two a lift. Why do crabs never give to charity? Because they're shellfish. I'd like to make a shout out to sidewalks, for keeping me off the streets. How do you make hold water? You boil the hell out of it. Due to quarantine, I'll only be telling inside jokes.</p>
